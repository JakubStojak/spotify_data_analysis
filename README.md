# Spotify Data Analysis
Analysis of data taken from the official Spotify Api (the spotify_data.csv file), containing over 169k instances of the most popular songs on the platform 
from 1928 to 2020, with various attributes. The goal of the process is to understand the basis on which people choose their 
everyday music - what factors influence their decisions. 

Conclusions based on the data so far:

- the most influential factor seems to be the song's release year - the higher that metric, the more likely it is to be played.
- a track's energy also plays a vital role in ensuring its popularity, although the correlation is not quite as strong 
- the most common song in the set is "Summertime", written in 1935b by George Gershwin, a popular jazz standard. Various covers of the piece appear 62 times. 
- other popular song titles include "Overture", "Angel", "Love", "You", "Stay"
